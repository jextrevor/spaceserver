# Space Server
My Space Simulation Server, created in HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, and Python; uses SocketIO, PeerJS, Markdown, JQuery, and Bootstrap.

Intended for running Star Trek-like space simulations, with 5 crew members (Commander, Navigator, Tactical, Operations, Engineer), a Flight Director for officiating the mission, and a Main View Screen for audiovisual feedback.

Works well in Firefox and Chrome.

**Please do not modify this server, even for personal use, without prior consent.**
